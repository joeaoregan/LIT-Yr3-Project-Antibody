	NINJA STAR (Renamed WeaponPlNinjaStar.h)

	*** This class contains the functions for spawning, rendering, and moving ninja stars. *** NEED TO MOVE THIS FUNCTIONALITY BACK, my bad, Joe
	Ninja stars are rotating objects, and they have a slower speed than Lasers but a higher
	points value. Like lasers the player automatically has unlimited ninja stars. Ninja stars
	can be used to cut Enemy Virus in two. Each player has a differnt colour ninja star, and
	sound effect.
