/*
	SAW:

	The players saw weapon can be used to cut Enemy Virus enemies in half. The smaller virus
	objects are then more managable for White Blood Cells to destroy. Saws are close range
	weapons, the player can not be damaged while using the saw, as other objects are deflected
	with it. It is limited to close range which makes it less usefull than Ninja Stars for
	destroying Orange Virus enemies, that explode on impact.
