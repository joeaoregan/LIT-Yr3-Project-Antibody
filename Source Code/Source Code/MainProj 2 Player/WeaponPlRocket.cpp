	2017/02/19 Added functionality to initialise the rocket, then create and launch the rocket after returning true from function in spawnRocket() function
	2017/02/16 When the rocket button is pressed it sets a timer, when it's released it sets power (score value), timer set to 2.0 seconds
				Bonus score added for rocket collisions
	2017/02/08 Added check so rocket explodes on collision with the game boundary
				Fixed the angle on the rocket moving up and down
				Added control for rocket movement in Weapon class
	2017/02/06 Added spawnRocket() function to create rockets for players, rocket movement can be controlled by player
				Added class for rockets Rocket.h (Renamed WeaponPlRocket.h)

/* 
	ROCKET WEAPON:

	Players start with a limited number of rockets, this can be increased by collecting
	rocket power ups that appear on screen. Only one rocket can be fired at a time.

	Rockets can be controlled by the player to guide towards the target
	A timer appears on screen when the rocket button is held to build up power
	This increases the score value on impact with enemy objects and if the player doesn't 
	let go of the button before the timer runs out the rocket will explode

	Players can collect rocket power ups to increase the number of rockets in their inventory
	and the current number of rockets for each player is indicated in the heads up display.
