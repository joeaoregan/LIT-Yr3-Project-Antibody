#### 4. Antibody Race Mode
2 Player split screen race mode test, as the theme for Games Fleadh 2017 was "Racing". This was not fully implemented. I began work on this near the beginning of the third-year project and abandoned due to time constraints.

#### 5. Antibody (Code::Blocks compatible)
I redid the entire project history to be compatible with Code::Blocks, for testing, and as part of testing for my fourth-year project

#### 6. Year-Four Networked Games Project
I've started creating a networked version of the game in Linux as part of my fourth-year project. The code base is cross platform, and I've included a finite state machine to help eliminate some of the problems with the original game.
