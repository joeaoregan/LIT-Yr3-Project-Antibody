Antibody 2D: Side-scrolling C++ game created using SDL2

# Antibody: Project Submission 

## 22/03/2017 (Updated Screenshots 31/01/2018)

Improved version of Games Fleadh winning entry from 8th of March, 2017. 

Antibody is a 2D sidescrolling game create using C++ and the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL 2) cross-platform software development library.

I've included the full Visual Studio 17 project folder, as setting up takes a bit of time, and the files are small. The included SDL Proj folder needs to be located on the C: drive, and the game should compile OK.

To set up an SDL project starting from scratch, the information needed for a number of platforms and IDE is available in the Lazy Foo' SDL tutorials (see link below)
