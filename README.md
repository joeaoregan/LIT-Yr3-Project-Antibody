## Updated Screenshots 31/01/2018

This is an adapted version of the third-year project submission version of Antibody 2D, so the project can be compiled in Code::Blocks

The Project Submission version is an improved version of Games Fleadh winning entry from 8th of March, 2017. 

Antibody is a 2D sidescrolling game create using C++ and the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL 2) cross-platform software development library.

#### Antibody Race Mode
2 Player split screen race mode test, as the theme for Games Fleadh 2017 was "Racing". This was not fully implemented. I began work on this near the beginning of the third-year project and abandoned due to time constraints.

#### Year-Four Networked Games Project
I've started creating a networked version of the game in Linux as part of my fourth-year project. The code base is cross platform, and I've included a finite state machine to help eliminate some of the problems with the original game.
